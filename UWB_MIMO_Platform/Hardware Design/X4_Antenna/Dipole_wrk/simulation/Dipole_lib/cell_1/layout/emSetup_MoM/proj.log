--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout is electrically large above 72.4 GHz (space wave radiation)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Substrate is electrically large above 9.33 GHz (surface wave radiation)
RF simulation can be less accurate as it ignores radiation
Consider:  - lowering the maximum frequency
           - simulating in MW mode

...reducing mesh
Automatic selection: direct dense matrix solver
Using multi-threading (4 threads)
Matrix size: 39 (reduced: 29)

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Port 1 does not have an explicit reference pin, 
S-parameters may become unphysical at higher frequencies.
